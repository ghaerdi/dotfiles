Themes are based on two colors to create the power line and border focus on
windows. A theme consists of a file named **colors.json** and a folder named
**img**. The file must have the following format:

```json
{
    "dark": [
        "#282a36",
        "#282a36"
    ],
    "grey": [
        "#434758",
        "#434758"
    ],
    "light": [
        "#ffffff",
        "#ffffff"
    ],
    "main": [
        "#A77AC4",
        "#A77AC4"
    ],
    "secondary": [
        "#7197E7",
        "#7197E7"
    ]
}
```
The **img** folder must have this content:
- primary.png
- bg-to-primary.png
- secondary.png
- bg-to-secondary.png
